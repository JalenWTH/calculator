# calculator
An original React calculator app

I originally created this app in CodePen with these 2 CDNs for React and the React DOM: 

https://unpkg.com/react@18.2.0/umd/react.development.js

https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18.2.0/umd/react-dom.development.js

If you want to run this in CodePen you will have to go to the settings, change the JavaScript interpreter to Babble, and add these two CDNs as external scripts
